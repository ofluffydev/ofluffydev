Notice: I decided to move to primarily using codeberg, I might push things here out of habit now and then, but see [my codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ofluffydev) for the rest of my stuff :P

Why? Read these, GitHub isn't the best platform to store all your projects/code.

I'm a computer science and software engineering enthusiast who thrives on building meaningful, practical tools! (Especially ones that repurpose older hardware or empower others to be more productive)

I specialize in systems programming, low-level Rust, and web tech like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I also know my way around Java and several other languages.

I'm driven by impact. If a project doesn’t help someone or solve a real problem, I usually don’t bother. I focus on work that makes a difference, whether that’s a fast bootloader, a collaborative social tool, or a better way to organize tech knowledge.
Areas of focus:

- Writing UEFI bootloaders and custom kernels in Rust
- Creating social platforms centered on collaboration and inclusivity
- Repurposing older computers for modern use
- Running a PC/laptop repair and build service on a tight budget
- Designing flexible tools usable as CLI programs, libraries, or web APIs

Favorites:
- **Programmers**: Linus Torvalds
- **Operating Systems**: Linux, especially Arch Linux and NixOS
- **Color**: Purple!
- **Languages**: Rust
- **Frameworks**: Next.js, Rust Axum, and Spring Boot
- **Editors**: VS Code and [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix)

I like debating ideas and pushing limits. If something seems like it shouldn't be possible, I’ll probably try to do it anyway.
